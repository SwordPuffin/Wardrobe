# Currently, Wardrobe is non-functional due to changes in the opendesktop api. This is being worked on right now, and a fix will be released as soon as possible.

# 🎨 Wardrobe

**Wardrobe** is a utility for installing community-made **Gnome Shell**, **GTK3/4**, **icon**, and **cursor** themes as well as wallpapers.

> ⚠️ **Wardrobe has not been tested for any desktop environments other than Gnome, so do not expect it to fully work in Cinnamon, Xfce, etc.**
